                        <p>You being the only person that I can trust is one of my greatest weaknesses but, I'm glad it's you because, you're the
                        only person I want to trust. I love that you listen to me ramble about computers or life and I love listening to you
                        ramble about what you want and what you're doing.</p>

                        <p>You're a shinging beacon of joy in my life and I want to just remind you that you have the ability to pursue anything
                        you desire and that I wholheartedly believe in you. You have such a profound and bold personality that I think the world
                        generally lacks and needs now more than ever. This distinct feature about you will help you glow in the future</p>

                        <p>We create our own paths and sometimes paths cross, somehow you have created a path to me and I can't imagine my life
                        without you in it. You're laugh and smile raidiate like the sunlight coming upon the earth.</p>

                                <p>I used  to believe that I had to do everything alone. It was easy to put all that pressure on me it meant that everything was my fault so everything was relying oon me to fix it. it made it easy not to consider any other factor. 
                                    That has started to change though. I still blame myself for pretty much everything but, the way I'm able to connect with you like no other despite you being so far has shown me that I and really everyone needs people. Whether it's for deeper conversations and connections like us, or a cheerleader friend or someone that grounds us people need others. I realized long ago i can't do it all alone but through you I realsized that I also don't have to isolate myself to unite others.
